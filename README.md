# RNN-AirQualityForecast

This is a course project which use air pollution data of Hanoi city during 5 months of observation. 
The original code was taken from this website: https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-lstm-models-for-multi-step-time-series-forecasting-of-household-power-consumption/
Because of size restriction of github. I only upload the sampled data for running this example.
The data is sampled and currently includes information about PM2.5, CO2, humility and temperature. Detail information can be found in pdf file.
